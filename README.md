Scripts included in this repository showcase the wide range of skills and techniques personally used in R

#Rut_Raking_Log
- This is a report generating script that is fed updated data once a week and generates spatially sorted reports for the upcoming week to be used by beach managers. This script is heavily annotated as its end users have introductory experience with R.

#scaleone_bootstrapsampling 
- This script utlizes bootstrapping resampling to remedy temporal and spatial discontinuities in a long term fisheries independent monitoring program data set before proceeding with further analysis. 

#spatial_random_sampling_point_creation
- This script is utlized to randomly generate sampling locations for a regional seagrass monitoring program. The sampling design is a randomized block design where sites are randomly generated with a rank order priority and then selected based on environmental samplability in post processing. 


#data_wrangling_reoganization
- This script was used to reorganize the data frame structure of a long term sea grass monitoring data set during a project revamp.

#telemetry_physiology_analysis
- This script provides examples of produced data visualizations showcasing acoustic telemetry and evnironmental data.

#BEF_stats 
- This script outlines biodiversity ecosystem function analysis including partial residual models and corresponding plots.
